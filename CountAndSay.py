# The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
#
# 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...
# 1 is read off as one 1 or 11.
# 11 is read off as two 1s or 21.
#
# 21 is read off as one 2, then one 1 or 1211.
#
# Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.
#
# Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
#
# Example:
#
# if n = 2,
# the sequence is 11.
